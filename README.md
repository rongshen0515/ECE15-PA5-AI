# ECE15-PA5-AI

My not very smart AI for ECE15

Pros:
 - Able to prevent player from winning (only works if win is horizontal or diagonal to the right) 
 - Able to place the winning move if it is about to win
 - Able to not crash (huge accomplishment)
 - More emotionally stable than my girlfriend (I don't have one)

Cons: 
 - Braindead when it comes to vertical wins
 - Also braindead when it comes to diagonal to the left
 - Does not know how to play Clash Royale
 - Does not do my dishes
